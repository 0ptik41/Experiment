# Experiment - Yes, I know this is a bad idea

This is a silly idea, but I want to create a tiny program that's like a russian
nesting doll and is able to massively grow in size to be a much larger program
that does something very different than what the tiny file appeared to do! 


# Why are you doing this? 

I'm not that bright. People do this kind of thing all the time making terrible
software and I'm curious how one would go about doing it. It's not like I'm 
going to use this as a programming or design philosophy elsewhere. I just want
to try something that sounds like a weird challenge.
